# dotfiles (local)

The main [repo](https://github.com/mfedoten/dotfiles) contains most of the dotfiles. This repository contains per-machine configurations.

### Config

I am using Ubuntu Gnome 22.04 LTS. A bit about the setup:
- Theme:
  * I'm using default Ubuntu theme (Yaru) or [Arc-Darker theme](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme).
  * Icons: [Papirus](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme). I also played around with [Arc](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-icon-theme) abd [Numix](https://itsfoss.com/install-numix-ubuntu/) icons.
  * Shell theme: Arc-Dark.
- The wallpaper I am using is in the `extras/wallpapers/` directory.
- Extensions:
  * Alt tab lift first window
  * Dash to dock
  * Multi monitors add-on
  * Native window placement
  * Places status indicator
  * Removable drive menu
  * User themes
  * Windownavigator
- Tilix terminal + Iceberg theme

### Todo

Next time try to script those settings as described [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/971067/how-can-i-script-the-settings-made-by-gnome-tweak-tool).
