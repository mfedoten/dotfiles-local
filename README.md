# dotfiles (local)

The main [repo](https://github.com/mfedoten/dotfiles) contains most of the dotfiles. This repository contains per-machine configurations.

### Config

I am using Ubuntu Gnome 22.04 LTS. A bit about the setup:
- Theme. I'm using default Ubuntu theme (Yaru) or [Arc-Darker theme](https://github.com/jnsh/arc-theme) ```sudo apt install arc-theme```
- The wallpaper I am using is in the `extras/wallpapers/` directory.
- Extensions:
  * [`quake-mode`](https://github.com/repsac-by/gnome-shell-extension-quake-mode) to support Quake mode for Tillix terminal under Wayland.
  * `Native window placement`
  * `Ubuntu AppIndicators`
  * `Ubuntu Dock`
  * `User Themes`
  * `windowNavigator`
  
- Tilix terminal + Iceberg theme

### Todo

Next time try to script those settings as described [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/971067/how-can-i-script-the-settings-made-by-gnome-tweak-tool).
